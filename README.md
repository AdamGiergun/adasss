This is my repository for Gentoo packages. Contains experimental packages for Android Studio (stable, beta and canary) to be able for installing these side by side.

This repository is available on [Gentoo repositories](https://repos.gentoo.org) list, so to use it do:
```
	$ eselect repository enable adasss
```
Of course, if you want to use my packages immediately, don't forget to do:
```
	$ emerge --sync adasss
```
It is possible to report bugs on [Gentoo Bugzilla](https://bugs.gentoo.org/) by starting title with (e.g.) 
```
	dev-util/android-studio-2021.1.1.22::adasss
```
But if it regards Android Studio crash, while trying to run emulator, first try to uninstall and install emulator again.

Also, if you haven't seen it yet, take a look at the [official Gentoo Wiki article on Android Studio](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Android_studio)
